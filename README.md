# MkDocs

Project documentation with Markdown

PyPI Version Build Status Coverage Status

MkDocs is a **fast**, **simple** and **downright** gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. It is designed to be easy to use and can be extended with third-party themes, plugins, and Markdown extensions.

Please see the [Documentation]("https://www.mkdocs.org/") for an introductory tutorial and a full user guide.

# Features
 - Build static HTML files from Markdown files.
 - Use Plugins and Markdown Extensions to enhance MkDocs.
 - Use the built-in themes, third party themes or create your own.
 - Publish your documentation anywhere that static files can be served.
 - Much more!
